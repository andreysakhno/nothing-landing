3. **SCSS Mastery**: Improved my understanding of SCSS, utilizing mixins and variables to write more modular, maintainable, and scalable stylesheets.
4. **Responsive Design Principles**: Deepened my knowledge of responsive design, learning how to build layouts that adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes using a mobile-first approach.
